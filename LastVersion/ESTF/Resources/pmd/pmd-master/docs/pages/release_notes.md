### New and noteworthy

#### Dart support

Thanks to the contribution from [Maikel Steneker](https://github.com/maikelsteneker), and built on top of the ongoing efforts to fully support Antlr-based languages,
PMD now has CPD support for [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/).

Being based on a proper Antlr grammar, CPD can:
*   ignore comments
*   ignore imports / libraries
*   honor [comment-based suppressions](pmd_userdocs_cpd.html#suppression)

### Modified Rules

*   The Java rule {% rule "java/errorprone/AssignmentToNonFinalStatic" %} (`java-errorprone`) will now report on each
    assignment made within a constructor rather than on the field declaration. This makes it easier for developers to
    find the offending statements.

*   The Java rule {% rule "java/codestyle/NoPackage" %} (`java-codestyle`) will now report additionally enums
    and annotations that do not have a package declaration.
