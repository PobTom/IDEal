  <d0>Hi! So what does your program need to do?
Talk me through - step by step.</d0>
  <d1>And how does your code look like?
Tell me what happens in each line.</d1>
  <d2>Which bit doesn't work?
Tell me what it's supposed to do and why you think it SHOULD work?</d2>
<d3>I hope that things have cleared up a bit now!
If you still can't figure it out - try other help options!
Good duck... I mean: luck! :)</d3>
